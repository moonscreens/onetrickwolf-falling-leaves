# pixijs-intro-example (falling leaves üçÇ)

This is my first attempt at an intro stream for a Twitch stream largely made to test [gif-to-webm-please](https://github.com/onetrickwolf/gif-to-webm-please) 
out.

Currently allows 2 emotes max per message and supports all Twitch and BTTV emotes.

URL: https://onetrickwolf.github.io/pixijs-intro-example/

`debug` can be set as a query parameter to show performance stats and `channel=twitch_username` can be set to 
override the default channel (currently https://www.twitch.tv/moonmoon).

Example: https://onetrickwolf.github.io/pixijs-intro-example/?debug&channel=onetrickwolf

## Motivation

Trying to set up a pipeline for Twitch emote integration with PixiJS as I would like to use PixiJS as a game engine 
for Twitch game jams. I previously [made a game jam game for MoonJam 2021](https://github.com/onetrickwolf/moonjam-2021-onetrickwolf) 
but could not support animated emotes or emotes from BTTV. Also the existing solutions used by existing [moonmoon intro 
screens](https://github.com/moonscreens/) and [twitch-chat-emotes](https://www.npmjs.com/package/twitch-chat-emotes) had some issues for PixiJS.

## External Dependencies

Uses `https://gif-emotes.opl.io/` from [twitch-chat-emotes](https://github.com/CalebBabin/twitch-chat-emotes) to 
grab BTTV JSON.

Uses a deployed AWS Lambda of [gif-to-webm-please](https://github.com/onetrickwolf/gif-to-webm-please) to convert 
animated emotes.

## Roadmap

- Eventually turn temporary lambda into more of a real API with a real domain.
- Add more configurations:
  - Change or remove background
  - Adjust amount of leaves or leaf images
  - Add some debugging controls
  - Number of emotes allowed
  - Special configs based on subscriber status similar to `twitch-chat-emotes`
- Would like to eventually implemented this with [FFmpeg WASM](https://github.com/ffmpegwasm/ffmpeg.wasm) as well so
  conversion can be done completely in browser. FFmpeh WASM only works with Chromium 79 and above though and OBS is
  currently still on Chromium 75.
- Potentially make common library or contribute to `twitch-chat-emotes`
- Performance tweaks, currently GSAP as a Tween engine seems to be the cause of performance issues not sure why...

## More Resources

If you'd like to make a stream intro (especially a 3D one) I'd highly recommend [moonmoon intro screens](https://github.com/moonscreens/) and [twitch-chat-emotes](https://www.npmjs.com/package/twitch-chat-emotes).

I'll be continuing to develop these methods and standardize them but I don't consider this example quite as 
developed or stable as the existing stream intros.

### Credits

- Tweening taken from or inspired by [this falling leaf animation](https://codepen.io/MAW/pen/KdmwMb) but 
  modified to work 
  for PixiJS with pixi-projection
- Much of the parsing logic taken from or inspired by [twitch-chat-emotes](https://www.npmjs.com/package/twitch-chat-emotes)
